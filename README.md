# The Portfolio
I have come to realize that many of my projects are spread throughout the vast corners of the internet. This repo attempts to list all of these projects.

## Serious Projects
These are projects I am actively working on or maintaining.

## Past Projects
These are completed or finished projects that are no longer in development. They are organized in this order: CLIs, Tutorials, Video Games.

**Hack Beta**  
I served as the Marketing Director for the University of Mississippi's first hackathon. You can read more about the event [here](https://olemiss.edu/news/2024/04/hack-beta-hackathon/).  

**Targeted Advertising: How Companies And Governments Are Weaponising User Data Against The Consumer**  
I wrote a research paper and published it in a peer-reviewed academic journal at the University of Mississippi.  
  
*Abstract*:
> With the recent rise of a new digital age, many people are ditching more traditional methods of performing everyday tasks and replacing them with free and convenient online services. But as the saying goes, there is no such thing as a free lunch, and that sentiment holds true in terms of online services as well. Consumers pay for these online services with something much more valuable than moneyâ€”their personal data. This paper explores how companies and governments present consumers with targeted advertisements, shows how targeted advertisements are inherently manipulative, and gives an example of one government and one company using this technology to influence the behavior of its target demographics. The paper concludes with a discussion of the ethical implications of the research, states its limitations, proposes possible solutions by providing contextual information, and concludes by arguing that the only way to change this behavior would be through legislative measures.

**RGB LED Based on Distance**  
I created this tutorial while learning how to use the Arduino micro controller. The project uses an ultrasonic senor to judge the distance of an object in front of it. It then lights up a red, green, or blue LED based off that information. The tutorial teaches students the basics of Arduino and of the Arduino IDE. Since publishing, the tutorial has amassed over twelve thousand views on Hackster.io. [Link](https://www.hackster.io/codernoob/rgb-led-based-on-distance-ba94f8)

**Rolling Rooms**  
Rolling Rooms is an 2D puzzle game where the player has to avoid obstacles, hit buttons, and fly in anti-gravity traps all without being able to control the player! This game was made in the Weekly Game Jam 153 (2020). [Link](https://doublehelix.itch.io/rolling-rooms)
