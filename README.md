# The Portfolio
I have come to realize that many of my projects are spread throughout the vast corners of the internet. This repo attempts to list all of these projects.

## Serious Projects
These are projects I am actively working on or maintaining.

**RGB LED Based on Distance**  
I created this tutorial while learning how to use the Arduino micro controller. The project uses an ultrasonic senor to judge the distance of an object in front of it. It then lights up a red, green, or blue LED based off that information. The tutorial teaches students the basics of Arduino and of the Arduino IDE. Since publishing, the tutorial has amassed over twelve thousand views on Hackster.io. [Link](https://www.hackster.io/codernoob/rgb-led-based-on-distance-ba94f8)

**Rolling Rooms**  
Rolling Rooms is an 2D puzzle game where the player has to avoid obstacles, hit buttons, and fly in anti-gravity traps all without being able to control the player! This game was made in the Weekly Game Jam 153 (2020). [Link](https://doublehelix.itch.io/rolling-rooms)
